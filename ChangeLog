2015-02-20  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@utoronto.ca>:

	* pyatmlab-0-0-66

	* pyatmlab/collocations.py(ProfileCollocationDescriber):

	(interpolate_profiles):

	- Add interpolation matrices to the returned p_int, s_int objects so
	that they will not be lost later.

	(smooth):

	- Be more verbose as to keep track of what is going on

	- DISABLE limiting to shared range, as this causes problems in keeping
	track of interpolation matrices that can be consistently used if error
	covariances are obtained only later.  Instead, flag interpolation
	matrices with nans where extrapolation would be going on.

	- Only return error if requested.  In some cases, such as for TANSO, I
	can't get S because bucketing is based on partial columns, that can
	only be calculated after smoothing.  In this case, postpone the
	error estimations, but do communicate all information needed to
	consistently regrid and smoothen error estimates.

	(partial_columns):
	
	- Adapt for changed signature in smooth()

	- Don't hardcode for "CH4_profile"

	- Rewrite all operations in terms of linear operators

	- Apply same linear operators to error estimates, return those as well

	(compare_profiles_raw, compare_profiles_smooth):

	- Adapt for changed signature of interpolate_profiles()

	(_limit_to_shared_range):

	- Made changen in order to fix problems elsewhere, but this method is
	disabled now anyway...

	(_calc_error_propagation):

	- Adapt to (properly?) take care of nans in W_1 and S_1.  The ones in
	W_1 are worst because pinv might hang!

	(_get_smoothing_error):

	- Move code to calculate the smoothing error out of smooth() because I
	might need to call this one separately if TANSO is involved.

	* pyatmlab/dataset.py(Dataset):

	(extend_with_doy_localtime):

	- Add doy and localtime to ndarray

	(extend_with_dofs):

	- Add dofs to ndarray

	* pyatmlab/db.py(SimilarityLookupTable):

	(get_index_tuple):

	- Return only a single tuple.

	(get_index_tuples):

	- Yield many tuples.

	(lookup):

	- Lookup the entry for a single datapoint

	(lookup_all):

	- Lookup the entries for many datapoints

	(lookaround):

	- When a particular entry is not found, average neighbouring entries

	* pyatmlab/math.py:
	
	(linear_interpolation_matrix):

	- Fill extrapolated values with nan, not edges

	(regrid_ak):

	- Take proper care of nans in z and A

	(smooth_profile):

	- Take proper care of nans in xa en ak

	* pyatmlab/physics.py(AKstats.dofs):

	- Adapt to avoid bug, see https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/5560

	* pyatmlab/stats.py(bin_nd_sparse):

	- Make sure we're not binning nans.

2015-02-06  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@utoronto.ca>:

	* pyatmlab-0-0-65

	* pyatmlab/collocations.py(ProfileCollocationDescriber):

	(interpolate_profiles):

	- Do not consider all negative values invalid, don't want to flag
	small negative values that can arise from retrievals.  For now fix
	arbitrarily at -100

	- Bugfix: don't try to extend interpolation matrix to flagged areas of
	the z-grid, don't want nans in there.  Set W=0 elsewhere.

	(smooth):

	- For averaging kernel, separately keep track of need for axes
	swapping and need for conversion

	(partial_columns):

	- Rather than calling vmr2nd and integrate_with_height directly, call
	those with dummies (either 1 or columns of the unit matrix) so that I
	get scalars/vectors that I can use to calculate error propagation.
	Secondly, only consider the valid_range at the end, since off-diagonal
	errors outside the considered partial column range do propagate into
	the actual partial columns.

	- Also return estimated errors.

	* pyatmlab/dataset.py(ProfileDataset):

	- New attribute A_needs_swapping.  Defaults to NotTrueNorFalse.

	* pyatmlab/datasets.py:

	(TansoFTSBase):

	- Set A_needs_swapping=False

	(ACEFTS.read_single):

	- Bugfix: error covariance diagonal should be set to *squares* of the
	reported errors, not the reported errors themselves.

	(Eureka_PRL_CH4_HDF):

	- Set A_needs_swapping = True

	(_read):

	- Make sure I actually DO turn around all fields that need to be
	turned around.

	- Make sure all SI conversions are applied exactly as defined in the
	source.  Except for some.

	* pyatmlab/math.py(get_transformation_matrix):

	- Obtain standard matrix for the linear transformation for ANY linear
	function.  This "standard matrix" is m x n (m>0, n>0), so it can also
	be a vector in practice.  See Lay (2003), Theorem 10 (page 83).


2015-02-02  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@utoronto.ca>:

	* pyatmlab-0-0-64

	* pyatmlab/collocations.py(ProfileCollocationDescriber):

	- Fix bug in error propagation under smoothing (S_1, S_2).  It appears
	to work now!  Next step will be to calculate error in profiles and
	partial columns, again according to Vigouroux et al.

2015-01-30  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@utoronto.ca>:

	* pyatmlab-0-0-63

	(ProfileCollocationDescriber): 

	- Bugfix in flagging interpolation matrix

	- More code for error propagation calculations.  Not working yet.

	* pyatmlab/datasets.py:

	(Dataset): Change metaclass.  No need to have ABCMeta, was a
	misunderstanding.  Do use DocStringInheritor.

	(ACEFTS): Make fake (diagonal) SA matrix

	(Eureka_PRL_CH4_HDF):

	- Set necessary attributes: A_needs_converting, range, aliases
	- Also read CH4.MIXING.RATIO.VOLUME_ABSORPTION.SOLAR_APRIORI (why was
	it missing?)
	- Turn around profiles when z is descending

	* pytmlab/physics.py:

	- Don't do dof

	* pyamtlab/tools.py(DocStringInheritor):

	- Copied metaclass recipe by Paul McGuire with a small addition.

	Vigouroux et al. (2007) and Calisesi et al. (2005)

	* pyatmlab/physics.py(AKStats):

	- Bugfix, don't bin visualisingly by all bins I use for the db to
	Naoko

2015-01-22  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@utoronto.ca>:

	* pyatmlab-0-0-61

	* pyatmlab/dataset.py(SingleFileDataset.read):

	- Make sure we pass self.srcfile to super().read() if nothing is
	given.  This in turn ensures it will be converted from Path to str if
	needed.

	* pyatmlab/datasets.py(Eureka_PRL_CH4_HDF):

	- Adapted from EurekaHDF.  Fixed remaining bugs in reading routine.
	It appears everything works now.

	  called, as this data will be needed
	
	(partial_columns):

	- Add parcol_CH4 to self.p_col and self.s_col after calculating it.

	* pyatmlab/db.py(SimilarityLookupTable):

	- New class used to construct a set of diverse TANSO profiles

	(AKStats.summarise_dof_stats):

	- Rewrite and improve this method

	(mean_local_solar_time):

	- Move to new module `time`

	* pyatmlab/stats.py:

	(bin_nd_sparse):

	- Special version of bin_nd for sparse data (i.e. if we want only a
	few data points)

	(binsnD_t_2D):

	- Improved version of bins4D_to_2D, working from any number of
	dimensions, but reducing always to 2-D still

	* pyatmlab/time.py:

	- New module with mean_local_solar_time moved from physics, and
	dt_to_doy_mlst newly created to split datetime in doy and mlst.
	
2015-01-09  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@utoronto.ca>:

	(summarise_dof_stats): Worked on investigated DOF stats

	(mean_local_solar_time): Calc. from lon. and utctime

	* pyatmlab/stats.py:

	(bins_4D_to_2D): Downmerge 4D bin thingy to 2D.  Should be more
	generic...

	(iter_bins4D): Helper for above

	* pyatmlab-0-0-57

	* pyatmlab/collocations.py(CollocationDescriber):

	- Some very small changes
	
2014-12-04  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@utoronto.ca>:

	* pyatmlab-0-0-56

	* pyatmlab/collocations.py(CollocationDescriber):

	- Fig bug with regridding.  No need to "remove data above range".  I'm
	going to interpolate on the new grid *anyway*.  Removing just risks
	removing too much and extrapolating where there is no need.  It's
	extrapolation I want to avoid, the way to do this is to set the target
	grid (from z_xh) small enough and not to remove data wherever I'm
	above lowest_z_max.

	- Write out all DOFs to get a histogram with pgfplots

	- Move get_shared_range into its own routine.  I might have to look at
	lower limits as well.

	* pyatmlab/datasets.py(EurekaHDF):

	- Remove workaround for reading PEARL HDF4 file, after bugfix in
	Python-hdf4.

	* pyatmlab/math.py:

	(linear_interpolation_matrix):

	- Oops, W was turned around.  Fixed.

	(regrid_ak):

	- When interpolating profiles and further processing them, don't only
	hard-coded interpolate CH4 profiles, but also consider other fields,
	such as p and T.

	* pyatmlab/dataset.py:

	(DataFileError):

	- Superclass for InvalidFileError and InvalidDataError.

	(Dataset): Give up on masked arrays

	(ProfileDataset): Implemented get_z_for = get_z by default

	* pyatmlab/datasets.py:

	(TansoFTSv10x):

	- When getting z, get either the z for the CH4 profile or for the T
	profile.

	(ACEFTS):

	- Describe aliase p -> P_atm

2014-11-05  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@utoronto.ca>:

	* pyatmlab-0-0-52

	* pyatmlab/collocations.py(CollocationDescriber):

	- Continued work on partial columns.  Remains unfinished.

	- Split smoothing method in smaller methods

	* pyatmlab/dataset.py:

	(Dataset): Move 'range' attribute to ProfileDataset

	(ProfileDataset): Move 'range' attribute here.

	* pyatmlab/datasets.py:

	- Based on partial column sensitivity studies, write an estimated
	range for TANSO and ACE

	- Use logging rather than print 

	* pyatmlab/math.py(regrid_matrix):

	- Added, regridding a matrix

	* pyatmlab/physics.py(AKstats):

	- Added method to plot sensitivity density as opposed to range.  Sort
	of the integral of the range.

2014-10-28  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@utoronto.ca>:

	* pyatmlab-0-0-50

	* pyatmlab/collocations.py(CollocationDescriber):

	- Uh-uh, only plot averaging kernel stuff if we actually have
	averaging kernels.

	* pyatmlab/physics.py(AKStats):

	- Added method sensitivity_matrix_z.  Like sensitivity_matrix but a
	little more involved as I want to know what vertical range this
	corresponds to.

	- Also add contour labels.  To be tweaked.


2014-10-27  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@utoronto.ca>:

	* pyatmlab-0-0-49

2014-10-21  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@utoronto.ca>:

	* pyatmlab-0-0-48

	* pyatmlab/collocations.py:

	(CollocatedDataset):

	- Update error checking when primary can't be road

	(CollocationDescriber):

	- Do not try to extrapolate profiles, a prioris, or averaging kernels.
	Rather, when the three do not come on identical z-grids (i.e. for
	Tanso they don't), rather limit them all to the least common range.
	This is not absolute, as each profile may have its own z-grid.
	Therefore, cut them ALL off if more than a fraction (defaulting to
	0.5) at a certain level is outside the range.

	- Add a lot more comments explaining what I'm doing

	- Rename extend_common_grid to regrid_profiles, to more accurately
	describe what's going on.

	- Ensure that xa, xh, ak are all on the same z-grid prior to further
	processing

	- Some related bugfixes

	- Also show negative part of averaging kernels

	* pyatmlab/math.py:

	(regrid_ak):

	- Optionall cut away when z is outside teh old grid

	(apply_W_A):

	- Bugfix for location of pinv

	(smooth_profile):

	- Centralise actual work to smoothen a single profile (no
	vectorisation)

	* pyatmlab/tools.py(array_equal_with_equal_nans):

	- Like array_equal, but consider nans to be equal too.

2014-10-03  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@utoronto.ca>:

	* pyatmlab-0-0-47

	* pyatmlab/collocations.py(CollocationDescriber):

	- Fix bug in correcting averaging kernels.  Were not actuallly being
	corrected!

	* pyatmlab/math.py(convert_ak_ap2vmr):

	- Move averaging kernel conversion to its own function

2014-09-23  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@utoronto.ca>:

	* pyatmlab-0-0-45

	* pyatmlab/collocations.py(CollocationDescriber):

	- Add mask info in filename

	- Temporarily (?) disable setting a priori to nan outside interpolated
	range.  It should not be necessary to extrapolate a priori where I
	have averaging kernels but not a priori...

	- When calculating percentiles, consider only finite data.

	- Write data file for raw and smooth, filtered and unfiltered

	* pytmlab/dataset.py(Dataset):

	- Reduce verbosity when reading granules

	* pyatmlab/graphics.py(print_or_show):

	- Allow to write multiple data files

2014-09-17  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@utoronto.ca>:

	* pyatmlab-0-0-44

	* pyatmlab/collocations.py:

	(CollocatedDataset):

	- When collocating, use default start_date, end_date derived from base
	datasets

	- When reading, only return those collocations in the time period
	requested, nothing more.

	(CollocationDescriber):

	- Work on figure filenames
	- Set intervals to lowest/highest values of timedelta64 in seconds, as
	 +/- infinity does not work as expected (see also
	 https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/5079).
	- Allow to set mask explicitly, externally
	- Don't extrapolate averaging kernel matrix
	
	* pyatmlab/dataset.py:

	(Dataset):

	- Add attribute 'related' that can be used to point to dmp-object

	(MultiFileDataset):

	- When reading period, include end points
	- When looking for granules, also consider 'tod' in seconds since
	midnght

	* pyatmlab/datasets.py(ACEFTS):

	- Orbit alone is not unique, (also) consider time
	- chain ValueError with InvalidFileError if reading fails, so it can
	be properly caught higher up

	* pyatmlab/math.py(linear_interpolation_matrix):

	- Pointed out caveat with extrapolation

2014-08-26  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@utoronto.ca>:

	* pyatmlab-0-0-43

	* pyatmlab/collocations.py:

	(CollocatedDataset):

	- Use own errors to catch more tightly

	(CollocationDescriber):

	- Correct non-finite z as invalid

	- Also elsewhere, take care of nans (giving up on masked arrays)

	* pyatmlab/datasets.py(TansoFTSv10x):

	- Switch to k=1 spline interpolation (i.e. linear) to make
	extrapolation less bad.

	- Interpolate in logq, not in q

	- Give up on masked arrays, flag manually with nans instead, and make
	sure this doesn't mess up p2z (as masked arrays do!)

	* pyatmlab/physics.py(p2z_hydrostatic):

	- Catch negative p or T (could indicate flag or bug)

	* pyatmlab/tools.py(rec_concatenate):

	- More liberal concatenation of record arrays.  As long as the field
	names are the same, who cares that the order in the structured dtype
	is different?

2014-08-20  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@utoronto.ca>:

	* pyatmlab-0-0-42

	* pyatmlab/collocations.py(CollocationsDescriber):

	- In smoothing, take care of the situation when xa and A come from
	another source and are not on the same vertical grid, so that
	interpolation is needed.  Only partially tested, likely still buggy.

	* pyatmlab/constants.py: +hecto

	* pyatmlab/dataset.py(Dataset):

	- Add method get_additional_field, not implemented here

	* pyatmlab/datasets.py: get hecto from constants

	* pyatmlab/math.py:

	(regrid_ak): Move W*A*W' to separate function

	(apply_W_A): Actual W*A*W'

	* pyatmlab/physics.py:

	(p2z_hydrostatic): Optionally extend p/t/q, USE AT OWN RISK,
	assumptions wholly inappropriate if extending is far!

2014-08-15  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@utoronto.ca>:

	* pyatmlab-0-0-41

	* pyatmlab/collocations.py(CollocationDescriber):

	- Fix serious bug in smoothing, where Avmr-correction was not applied

	* pyatmlab/dataset.py:

	- Force each dataset to say if A should be corrected to Avmr

	* pyatmlab/datasets.py:

	- For TansoFTS, A needs no correction

	* pyatmlab/tools.py:

	- Added NotTrueNorFalse, inspired by
	  http://stackoverflow.com/a/25330344/974555

2014-08-15  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@utoronto.ca>:

	* pyatmlab-0-0-40

	* pyatmlab/collocations.py(CollocationDescriber):

	- Reinsert extending xh with a-priori where outside the range of xh,
	this was accidentally deleted earlier

	* pyatmlab/dataset:

	(Dataset):

	- Cosmetic change

	(ProfileDataset.read):

	- Rather than having .read() as an abstract method, make an
	implementation here that extends the parent .read() with adding a
	z-profile upon/after reading.  Note that the real reading
	implementation is still in children's read_ so that's actually done
	before.  A new n_prof attribute will be used to determine profile
	sizes.

	(ProfileDataset.get_z):

	- Don't abstract this one either, rather return dt["z"].  Children
	super() this and catch the problem if there is no 'z' yet.

	* pyatmlab/datasets.py:

	(TansoFTSv10x):

	- Add n_prof

	- Try to get_z from super first

	- Account for another bug with masked arrays

	(TansoFTSv001):

	- Try to get_z from super first

	(ACEFTS):

	- Inherit from ProfileDataset

	- Add n_prof

	- Try to get_z from super first

2014-08-12  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@utoronto.ca>:

	* pyatmlab-0-0-39

	* pyatmlab/collocations.py(CollocationDescriber):

	- When extending common grid, do not insist on constant z-grid

	- Clarify smoothing rules

	- WARNING NEEDS WORK BEFORE APPLYING TO NON-PEARL DATA

	* pyatmlab/dataset.py:

	(Dataset):

	- Clarified on risks of misusing start_date

	(MultiFileDataset):

	- When using a shelve copy, don't bother on read only.  Might only
	  mean things go wrong later.  Stored data lost anyway.

	* pyatmlab/datasets.py:

	(TansoFTSv10x):

	- Add comment clarifying pressure level mayhem

	- When getting z, merge pressure grids that T/q and CH4 are on, so I
	  can calculate z-levels for CH4-retrieval.  Needs a little bit of
	  extrapolation.

	* pyatmlab/physics.py(p2z_hydrostatic):

	- Restore test for p[0] < p0 < p[-1] as per Patrick discussion

2014-08-08  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@utoronto.ca>:

	* pyatmlab-0-0-38

	* pyatmlab/dataset.py(MultiFileDataset):

	- When I can't open the granule start times file, open a *copy* read
	only.  Opening the same one read only still doesn't work...

	* pyatmlab/datasets.py:

	(TansoFTSBase, TansoFTSv001, TansoFTSv10x):

	- Split these classes into different versions.

	* pyatmlab/math.py:

2014-07-23  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@utoronto.ca>:

	* pyatmlab-0-0-36

	* pyatmlab/collocations.py(CollocationDescriber):
	
	- Comment out unused code and removed lying comment
	
	* pyatmlab/dataset.py:

	(Dataset):

	- Started on 'combine' method that finds corresponding measurements
	from another dataset (must be exact subset).

	(MultiFileDataset):

	- Get info or granule

	(SingleMeasurementPerFileDataset):

	- Copy info from filename into header

	* pyatmlab/collocations.py(CollocatedDataset):

	- Bugfix: when reading many primaries, keep track of what secondaries
	already were returned; we don't want [(A1, B1), (A2, B1)] if both A
	and B are going to be concatenated in one yield!

	- Bugfix: have a small timedelta when considering segments, so we
	don't try to find new collocations for a 0.001 second period.

	- Bugfix: Make sure batches that are written to disk cover the full
	segment, without leaving any gaps, even if those gaps are verified to
	be free of collocations.

	* pyatmlab/datasets.py:

	- Use an OrderedDict rather than a dict when collecting header and
	body info, to guarantee that the subsequently converted dtype is
	consistent.

	- Give up on masked arrays.  They are buggy as hell.

	corner case of array([0]) with ndim=0 not being like
	numpy.float32(0))

	* pyatmlab/tools.py:

	(_validate_one):

	- When stuff goes wrong, write more info, such as type and function
	name
