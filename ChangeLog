	* pyatmlab-0-0-15

	* pyatmlab/constants.py:

	- Added ppm, ppb, ppt

	* pyatmlab/graphics.py:

	- Added missing import

	* pyatmlab/local/datasets.py(TansoFTS):

	- Revert to interpolated profiles, easier to deal with
	- Added fields holding pressure profiles for temperature, ch4

	* pyatmlab/physics.py(vmr2nd):

	- Added conversion function

	(p2z_oversimplified):

	- Added oversimplified p2z function

2014-03-14  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@utoronto.ca>:

	* pyatmlab-0-0-14

	* pyatmlab/collocations.py(CollocatedDataset):

	- fix remaining bugs.  It works now.

	* pyatmlab/local/datasets.py:

	- Add name field to both classes

	* pyatmlab/stats.py:

	- Bugfix (was a hard find)

2014-03-13  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@utoronto.ca>

	* pyatmlab-0-0-13

	* pyatmlab/collocations.py(CollocatedDataset):

	- Renamed some attributes

	- Added property for max_interval, which is always a timedelta64
	object

	- Fixed the implementation of collocate and _collocate_bucket.  Seems
	correct now.

	* pyatmlab/dataset.py:
	
	(Dataset):

	- Fixed __setattr__ for properties
	- Added dummy implementation for abstract methods

	(NDACCGainesBruker.read):

	- Correctly add datetime64 to time field
	- Hard-coded fix for lat/lon

	* pyatmlab/stats.py(bin_nd):

	- Added some checks that bins are correct

	- Don't .pop() off bins/binners, just take the last value and pass
	all-but-one on; passed on value should in any case be a *copy*, not a
	reference!

	- It didn't work at all for >2 dimensions.  Now it seems correct.


2014-03-12  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@utoronto.ca>

	* pyatmlab-0-0-12

	* pyatmlab/collocations.py:

	- Added, started CollocatedDataset definition.  Most of the work is in
	the method .collocate and ._collocate_bucket, which collocates two
	ndarrays in lat/lon/time.  To be tested!

	* pyatmlab/dataset.py:

	- Added a .read_all() method.  Now and here an alias of read_period()
	without arguments.  Also added a HomemadeDataset class, currently
	empty.

	* pyatmlab/local/:

	- New directory, will contain stuff actually localised for my place,
	but can be adapted by users on other sites.

	* setup.py: Also include pyatmlab.local

2014-03-06  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@utoronto.ca>

	* pyatmlab-0-0-11

	* pyatmlab/dataset.py:

	- Fixed syntax for metaclass
	- Don't use ugly wanted attribute, rather just insist attributes exist
	in class, dynamically adding is asking for bugs imnsho
	- Fixed syntax for abstract methods
