2014-03-13  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@utoronto.ca>

	* pyatmlab-0-0-13

	* pyatmlab/collocations.py(CollocatedDataset):

	- Renamed some attributes

	- Added property for max_interval, which is always a timedelta64

	(Dataset):

	- Fixed __setattr__ for properties
	- Added dummy implementation for abstract methods

	- Added some checks that bins are correct

	- Don't .pop() off bins/binners, just take the last value and pass
	all-but-one on; passed on value should in any case be a *copy*, not a
	reference!

	- It didn't work at all for >2 dimensions.  Now it seems correct.

	without arguments.  Also added a HomemadeDataset class, currently
